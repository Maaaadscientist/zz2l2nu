 * \brief Allows to resolve a (possibly) relative path with respect to several

 *
 * A file or directory is search for in several locations, similarly to how
 * \c $PATH is used. The following locations are included by default:
 *  - \c $HZZ2L2NU_BASE/config
 *  - \c $HZZ2L2NU_BASE/data
 *
 * Other locations can be added with \ref AddLocation.
 *
 * If a path does not correspond to an existing file or directory, an exception
 * is thrown.
 * 
 * This class is a singleton, and user cannot construct an instance of it.
 * Instead, all functionality is implemented in static methods.
