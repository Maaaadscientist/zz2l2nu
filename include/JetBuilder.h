/**
 * \brief Lazily builds collection of reconstructed jets that pass analysis
 * selection
 *
 * Reads parameters from sections \c jets and \c ptmiss of the master
 * configuration. The latter specify how jets contribute to the type 1
 * correction of missing pt.
 *
 * Jets are checked against the kinematical selection specified in the
 * configuration, as well as jet ID. Selection on pileup ID is applied if the
 * corresponding filter object is provided to the constructor.
 *
 * Systematic variations in jets are implemented with the help of JetCorrector,
 * which also applies JER smearing. To follow the standard smearing algorithm,
 * this builder needs to be made aware of generator-level jets via method
 * \ref SetGenJetBuilder.
 *
 * Jet with corrected pt > 15 GeV (the exact meaning depends on the
 * configuration) are aggregated for \ref GetSumMomentumShift to be used for the
 * type 1 correction of missing pt. The details are controlled by section
 * \c ptmiss of the master configuration.  The following fields are supported:
 * - \c jer  Boolean indicating whether JER smearing should be propagated into
 *     missing pt.
 * - \c pog_jets  Optional boolean; defaults to false. Requests that jets with a
 *     high EM energy fraction are skipped from the computation and constituent
 *     muons are subtracted from the remaining jets.  This is how the standard
 *     type 1 correction is computed.
 * - \c fix_ee_2017 Optional boolean; defaults to false. Indicates whether the
 *   <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/MissingETUncertaintyPrescription?rev=91#Instructions_for_2017_data_with">EE noise mitigation</a>
 *   should be applied.
 * Jets that geometrically overlap with other objects (as checked with
 * IsDuplicate) are never propagated into the missing pt.
