/**
 * \brief Applies pileup ID selection to jets
 *
 * The selection is specified in the section \c pileup_id of the master
 * configuration. If this section is missing, the filter is disabled and accepts
 * all jets. The following fields are read from this section:
 * - \c pt_range Jets whose pt is outside of this range are accepted
 *   automatically.
 * - \c abs_eta_edges Edges between bins in |eta|, for which different working
 *   points of pileup ID are to be applied. The left edge of the first bin and
 *   the right edge of the last bin are not included (e.g. if there are two bins
 *   in total, the sequence must include a single number). If the same working
 *   point is to be applied regardless of |eta|, the sequence must be empty. In
 *   this case it's optional and may be omitted from the configuration.
 * - \c working_points Working points for pileup ID to be used in each |eta|
 *   bin. Must be encoded with one-letter strings "N" (for no selection), "L",
 *   "M", or "T" (for loose, medium, or tight working points).
