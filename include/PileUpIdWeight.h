/**
 * \brief Computes event weights that account for pileup ID scale factors
 *
 * A multivariate parameterization is used for the efficiency of the pileup ID
 * in simulation. Computed weights are cached on per-event basis.
 *
 * The behaviour is controlled by the section \c pileup_id of the master
 * configuration. Some information from it is extracted via PileUpIdFilter --
 * see its documentation on how the jet selection should be specified. In class
 * PileUpIdWeight it is assumed that section \c pileup_id exists; otherwise an
 * object of this class should not be constructed.
 *
 * Systematic variations in the scale factors are provided. The scale factors
 * for pileup and matched jets are varied simulatneously within each category
 * and independently between the categories.
