// List of the systematics that can be used in our framework.
// Please append this list and add a description when you add other systematics in the analysis.
// CAUTION: Every line has either to begin with // or to begin with the syst name.
// FIXME: We need to see if it's necessary at some point to be able to run on several uncertainties at once.
